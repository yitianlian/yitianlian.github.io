# Biography

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Tsinghua University, under the supervision of Prof. [Hongning Wang](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1313/4406.htm). I am also currently interning at Zhipu AI.

My research primarily focuses on **LLM RL**, especially **Agentic RL** and **efficient RL training for LLMs**. I am particularly interested in improving long-horizon planning and memory-aware training for LLM agents, while optimizing training efficiency under real-world infrastructure constraints.

Beyond research, I actively contribute to open-source LLM RL systems, including [slime](https://github.com/THUDM/slime) and [sglang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang). I am one of the core contributors to both **GLM-4.5** and **GLM-5**.

My past research experience includes working as a research intern at the Shanghai AI Lab. I also served as a research assistant at HKU, under the supervision of [**Prof. Difan Zou**](https://difanzou.github.io/). In addition, I was a visiting student at KAUST, where I worked with [**Dr. Guohao Li**](https://ghli.org/) and [**Prof. Bernard Ghanem**](https://www.bernardghanem.com/).
