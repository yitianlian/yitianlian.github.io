## ðŸ“¢ SGLang-veRL Server: From Engine to Server â€” Towards a More Flexible RLHF Rollout Interface


In this post, I introduce the design and motivation behind the **server-based rollout engine** in the `veRL` framework. Traditional RLHF pipelines often assume tight coupling between training process and offline engine, which makes real-world interaction difficult. This post walks through how we use server-based rollout engine in RLHF training process, enabling more flexible and scalable reinforcement learning workflows.
